# action_sms

action_sms is a lightweight wrapper based on [activesms](http://github.com/nofxx/activesms). action_sms allows you to use existing SMS Gateway Adapters and switch between them effortlessly without modifing your application code. Unlike [activesms](http://github.com/nofxx/activesms), action_sms does not implement any SMS Gateway Adapters. For this see [action_sms_gateways](http://github.com/dwilkie/action_sms_gateways)
